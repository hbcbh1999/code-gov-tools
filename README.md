# Code.gov Tools - Unlocking the potential of the Federal Government’s software.

## Introduction

[Code.gov](https://code.gov) is a website promoting good practices in code development, collaboration, and reuse across the U.S.  Government. Code.gov will provide tools and guidance to help agencies implement the [Federal Source Code Policy](https://sourcecode.cio.gov). It will include an inventory of the government's custom code to promote reuse between agencies. And it will provide tools to help government and the public collaborate on open source projects.

This repository is home to the code powering code.gov. To learn more about the project, check out the main [Code.gov project README](https://github.com/presidential-innovation-fellows/code-gov-pm/blob/master/README.md)

## Summary

We've created a suite of tools available at localhost:3001/
```
* Search repos: (localhost:3001/) search available repos that have been harvested into the database
* harvest JSON files: (localhost:3001/harvest) pull the latest set of agency repositories as defined in agency_endpoint.json
* Run API: (localhost:3001/api) an api to browse various agency repo json files in full
* Create/convert inventories: (localhost:3001/convert) tools to create/convert code repository schemas into the latest metadata schema
```

## Install
Please install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) first 
```
npm install
node codegovapi
```

## Configuration
1. In codegovapi.js, you'll need to update the credentials for your local MongoDB server and create a database (e.g., "testdatabase").

Find the line the says:
```
/* REPLACE 'process.env.MONGURI' with the URI for your local MongoDB instance */
var mongoDetails = process.env.MONGOURI;
```
2. Update the URI for mongoDB to match this format
```
mongodb://username:password@host:port/testdatabase
```

3.  Create a collection called 'repos' to house the repositories.

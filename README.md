# Code.gov API - Unlocking the potential of the Federal Government’s software.

## Introduction

[Code.gov](https://code.gov) is a website promoting good practices in code development, collaboration, and reuse across the U.S.  Government. Code.gov will provide tools and guidance to help agencies implement the [Federal Source Code Policy](https://sourcecode.cio.gov). It will include an inventory of the government's custom code to promote reuse between agencies. And it will provide tools to help government and the public collaborate on open source projects.

This repository is home to the code powering the code.gov API. To learn more about the project, check out the main [Code.gov project README](https://github.com/presidential-innovation-fellows/code-gov-pm/blob/master/README.md

## Summary

We've set up three dummy URLs: https://fakeagency1.apps.cloud.gov, https://fakeagency2.apps.cloud.gov, and https://fakeagency3.apps.cloud.gov. Each of these three houses a different code.json file in its root directory.

A simple search page to browse demo repos is at localhost:3001/

The API endpoint is at localhost:3001/api/
